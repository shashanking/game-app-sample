# Game App Sample

This is a sample Flutter mobile app project that demonstrates a login screen and a home screen with bottom navigation.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: A UI framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Dart: The programming language used to develop Flutter applications.

## Dependencies

- `responsive_sizer`: A Flutter package that provides responsive widgets and utilities to create adaptive user interfaces.

## Missing Implementations

- Forgot Password: The functionality to handle password recovery is not implemented in this sample project. You can add this feature by integrating it with your preferred backend or authentication service.
- Sign Up: The user registration process is not implemented in this sample project. You can extend the application by adding a sign-up form and handling the user registration logic.
- Backend Infrastructure: This sample project does not include a backend server or database. To fully implement the application, you will need to set up a backend infrastructure to handle user authentication, data storage, and other necessary functionality.
